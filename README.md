# 🍎 Fruit Freshness Detection 

This project explores how computer vision and deep learning can be used to assess the **freshness** of fruits based on images. By analyzing visual features such as color, texture, and signs of spoilage, the model classifies fruits as **fresh** or **rotten**.

## 🌟 Project Summary

This is a real-world inspired project built to:
- Automate fruit quality detection
- Demonstrate practical use of **transfer learning** in image classification
- Explore visual explainability through confidence-based predictions

Using a dataset of labeled fruit images (apples, bananas, oranges — both fresh and rotten), I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on **VGG16** to identify freshness from image data.

## ✨ Reflections

This project taught me more than just how to build a model. It taught me how to:
- Debug deep learning models when things go wrong
- Stay consistent even when results aren’t what I expected
- Trust the process — and enjoy it too
